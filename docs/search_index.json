Economists are concerned about the efficient allocation of resources. That is, could resources be reallocated in such a way to make society better off. Economists use mathematical, theory-based models to represent the aforementioned actors and how they interact in a market or some other economic activity. Only relevant features are included in models and not every detail. Empirical work is done to test economic theories. Mathematics is a necessary tool for economists. Although this book limits the use of mathematics, the reader should keep in mind that there is a mathematical relationship behind every graph presented. Economic concepts are used (explicitly or implicitly) by individuals, firms, and governments. An economist would say that most of your everyday life decisions are based on economic principles starting with the decision to get out of bed in the morning. The American Economic Association (AEA) has compiled a list of academic papers that help explain economic concepts using real world examples. Microeconomics and macroeconomics are the two large branches in economics. Microeconomics analyzes the behavior of individuals and firms whereas macroeconomics assesses the behavior of the economy as a whole. Important topics in macroeconomics are unemployment, interest rates, trade, national income, inflation, and many more. This book covers microeconomics which includes the following topics: Consumer theory: Consumer theory uses the concept of utility maximization to derive the demand curve. Consumer theory is important in terms of welfare economics, e.g., what are the welfare effects for the consumer after a policy, price, or income change. Producer theory: Whereas the goal of consumer theory is to derive the demand function, producer theory derives the supply function for a good. Production theory is less abstract than consumer theory because terms such as profit maximization and cost minimization are easier to understand. Demand and supply: The combination of demand and supply determines the quantity and price which clear the market and lead to a market equilibrium, i.e., a situation with neither excess demand nor excess supply. It is important to differentiate between a change in quantity demanded (supplied) versus a change in demand (supply). There are many applications of demand and supply such as analyzing the effects of the 2012 drought in the Midwest on crop prices or how an increase in carbon fiber demand for wind farms has spill-over effects on the market for high-end bikes. The concept of elasticity is introduced in the context of demand and supply as well. Perfect competition: Once the supply and demand model is developed, we will focus on different market structures. The first such structure is perfect competition that is characterized by price-taking behavior of the market actors, i.e., consumers and producers. Imperfect competition: As opposed to a perfectly competitive market where producers are price takers, imperfect competition is characterized by price-setting behavior. If there is one producers for a particular good, we talk about a monopoly. A small number of producers is called oligopoly. Examples of oligopoly are widely available such as Airbus and Boeing or car manufacturing. Game theory: The strategic interaction among economic agents is analyzed with game theory. Each game has three components: (1) players, (2) actions, and (3) payoffs. Examples of games are auctions, bargaining, football, or chess. Public Policy: Besides imperfect competition, there are many other examples where the market fails to provide the efficient outcome. For example, most economic analysis requires the existence of a market. There are many goods for which no market exists. Many of them are found in environmental economics such as clean water and clean air. We are going to look at the implications of the absence of markets and the limitations to what people call the free market, e.g., Gulf of Mexico Hypoxic Zone. Another example of market failure is the presence of asymmetric information. The used car market is a good example because two parties enter a contract where one party (buyer) is not fully informed. For example, we will also learn why dressing nicely for a job interview is important or why you should post as many photos as possible when you sell your car. Risk and uncertainty: Almost all activities that are conducted by consumers or firms involve some sort of uncertainty. Decisions that are made today, affect the outcome tomorrow which is usually uncertain. How do individuals and firms make decision given those uncertainties. There are many economic concepts that are useful in everyday life. Those concepts are analyzed in detail in the subsequent chapters. Some of the most important concepts are the following: Marginal Analysis: Economists focus on the margin, i.e., what is the benefit of the next good that is bought or sold, which leads to the concept of marginal analysis. Once you have purchased something, what matters is what you will do next. Can you make yourself better off? Our goal is to maximize total net benefit: the value of the good minus the cost. Hence, the additional (marginal) benefit must be bigger or equal the additional (marginal) cost. Examples are choosing the production quantity or renting a car. For the maximization of total benefit, we focus on marginal benefit and marginal cost. If the marginal benefit is larger than the marginal cost, total benefit will increase. If the marginal cost is larger than the marginal benefit, total benefit will decrease. The only time that total benefit will not rise or fall is when marginal benefit is equal to marginal cost. This is where total net benefit is maximized. Sunk Cost: A concept closely related to marginal analysis are sunk costs. Sunk costs are expenditures that have been made and cannot be recovered. Following from marginal analysis, sunk costs should be ignored. Since sunk costs cannot be changed, they should not influence decision-making. This concept is controversial because it does not always hold in reality. Opportunity Cost: Another example of costs that are considered by economists are opportunity costs which are the value of the next best alternative use of a resource, i.e., cost of forgone opportunities. For MPA students, the cost of going to the ONeill School is tuition plus the opportunity cost, i.e., salary you forgo by not working. Opportunity costs are important to consider, but often ignored. Opportunity costs relate to the key concept of scarcity. Once a resource has been used, it cannot be used for something else. Economics should be thought off in very broad terms and not just money and/or profit. Consider the example of saving human lives in the context of transport planning. In many regions in the U.S. and the world, people have a choice when it comes to transport modes (e.g., car, bike, train). Depending on the price of those modes, consumers substitute one for the other. There are also different fatality rates associated with each transport mode with cars probably having one of the highest. So if you increase train ticket prices to finance safety investments, people shift from the train to the road potentially causing more fatalities despite the investment in safety. Just focusing on road safety, an increase in the price of gasoline reduces road fatalities (Burke and Nishitateno, 2014). "],["real-versus-nominal-prices.html", "2.1 Real versus Nominal Prices", " 2.1 Real versus Nominal Prices Before starting with consumer theory, let us first look at index numbers, indices, and the difference between nominal and real prices. An index number assigns a single value to several individual numbers in order to quantify trends. An index is series of index numbers used to track a variables rise and fall over time. Important indices in economics are are the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or the S&amp;P 500. The CPI is important because it allows us to differentiate between real and nominal prices. In general, only real prices are important. Let us illustrate this point with an example. Suppose that your income in time period 1 is $100. The price of apples and milk is $5 and $10, respectively. You purchase 4 apples and 8 gallons of milk. In time period 2, your income is $120 and the price of apples and milk increased to $6 and $12, respectively. Although it seems that your income has increased from $100 to $120, you can only purchase the same quantities of apples and milk in both periods. The increase from $100 to $120 represents an increase in your nominal income. But since you cannot purchase more goods, your real income has remained the same. If your income increased to $110 in the second period, then your nominal income has increased whereas your real income has decreased. Many people compare 1970 gasoline prices to today and complain about the price increase without realizing that they are comparing nominal prices. This would be similar to complaining about the cost increase of a Rolls-Royce. In 1921, a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost cost $12,000 which at the time was equivalent to the price of three Cadillac. Besides the CPI, there are two other indices that can be used to differentiate real from nominal prices: GDP deflator and Producer Price Index (PPI). The GDP deflator includes goods and services purchased by businesses, governments, and foreigners whereas the CPI includes the price changes for consumer goods and services. The PPI includes goods and services purchased by producers and firms. For example, the price a large industrial firm pays for electricity is different, and behaves differently, than the price consumers pay. Very often, the prices of food and energy items are taken out of the CPI calculations because those prices are subject to large fluctuations and can result in an inaccurate reflection of the price level. The figure below illustrates the evolution of the CPI since 1978. The CPI is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services (Bureau of Labor Statistics). The CPI is a basket of about 80.000 items. The approximate weights in the basket are food and beverages (15%), housing (43%), apparel (4%), transportation (17%), medical care (6%), recreation (6%), education and communication (6%), and other goods and services (3%). Urban consumers represent about 87% of the U.S. Population. Figure 2.1: CPI for All Items in U.S. City Average, Medical Care in U.S. City Average, and Tuition, Other School Fees, and Childcare in U.S. City Average In this class, we measure all prices in real terms. We can use the following equation to calculate the CPI: \\[CPI_t = \\frac{MB_t}{MB_b} \\cdot 100\\] where \\(MB_t\\) and \\(MB_b\\) represents the cost of the market basket in time period t and the base year b, respectively. The CPI base year is 1982 to 1984 but because it is an index, the base year can be adjusted for specific purposes. The CPI is also used as an economic indicator to set policy targets or to adjust dollar values such as pensions. It is also used as a deflator for price series to translate nominal into real prices. For example, the figure below shows the nominal and the real price of gasoline. We can see that in 2000, the nominal price of gasoline was around $1.50 but the real price was over $2.00. For real and nominal energy prices going back to 1970, see the Real Prices Viewer from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Figure 2.2: Real and nominal US Regular All Formulations Gas Price. The GDP Implicit Price Deflator in United States is used to deflate the prices. Source: Federal Reserve Economic Data. For constant dollar calculations, you first have to chose a base year. As mentioned above, the base year for the CPI is the period 1982 to 1984. But we can also chose a different base year, e.g., 2020. If we apply the below constant dollar calculations with the base year of 2020, then we convert a nominal dollar amount into 2020 Dollars. The constant dollar calculation can be written as: \\[CD_b = \\frac{ND_t \\cdot CPI_b}{CPI_t}\\] where \\(CD_b\\) represents the constant dollar or real value in the base year, \\(ND_t\\) is the nominal value in period t, and \\(CPI_b\\) and \\(CPI_t\\) are the Consumer Price Index in the base period and period t, respectively. For example, assume the following parameters: \\(ND_{1979}=0.84\\) (May 1979), \\(CPI_{1979}=71.4\\) (\\(CPI=100\\) in 1982-1984), \\(CPI_{2012}=228.8\\), \\(b=2012\\) and \\(t=1979\\). Plugging those values into the equation for the constant dollar calculation and we get: \\[CD_{2012}=\\frac{ND_{1979} \\cdot CPI_{2012}}{CPI_{1979}}=\\frac{0.84 \\cdot 228.8}{71.4}=2.69\\] Let us consider a second example using the $12,000 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost. Let us use January 1921 and June 2020 as the two time points of interest. \\[CD_{2020}=\\frac{ND_{1921} \\cdot CPI_{2020}}{CPI_{1921}}=\\frac{12,000 \\cdot 257.797}{19.0}=\\$162,819.20\\] The figure below also shows that an increasing price series in nominal terms can actually be decreasing or flat in real terms. The fuel tax revenue in other states and at the federal level evolve similar to the one in Indiana. Figure 2.3: Real and nominal fuel tax revenue for Indiana. The GDP Implicit Price Deflator in United States is used to deflate the prices. Source: State Government Tax Collections, Motor Fuels - Selective Sales Taxes in Indiana from the Federal Reserve Economic Data. There are some problems with the CPI. First, there is a substitution bias which refers to the situation where consumers shift their purchases away from goods whose relative prices increase towards cheaper goods. The second problem is associated with new, higher priced goods. The CPI fails to take quality improvements into account that are responsible for the increase in prices. The last important concept presented in this section is the inflation rate which is the percentage change in the price level from one period to the next. The inflation rate can be calculated as follows: \\[\\pi_t=\\frac{CPI_t-CPI_{t-1}}{CPI_{t-1}}\\cdot 100\\] The figure below shows the inflation annual inflation rate in the U.S. from 1960 to 2020.

You will use FRED data for both exercises below. Real Gasoline Price: For this exercise, you will calculate the real price of gasoline that prevailed several years ago. The base period is the most recent month for which the CPI is available. Proceed as follows: Take the first letter of your last name and determine its place in the alphabet. For example, if your last name starts with G then the corresponding number is 7. Add that number to 1992 which results in the year you will be using for the nominal gasoline price. For example, if your last name starts with G, then the year of interest is 1999. Go to the CPI for All Urban Consumers: All Items in U.S. City Average and determine the value of the CPI for two dates: (1) the most recent month available and (2) January of the year determined in part (a). Go to US Regular All Formulations Gas Price and determine the price of gasoline in January of the year determined in part (a).

"],["consumer-theory.html", "3 Consumer Theory", " 3 Consumer Theory Consumer theory models individual decision making and consumer behavior. The goal of consumer theory is to derive the demand function. There are three components to consumer theory: The budget constraint is the income constraint faced by the consumer given prices and income. Consumer preferences are expressed using utility functions and indifference curves. Note that an indifference curves represent the contour line associated with a particular utility level of the utility function. Your preferences are independent of your income and prices! Optimal consumer choice results from the combination of the budget constraint and consumer preferences. We look at how those optimal choices are affected given changes in prices, income, and/or policies? It is important to understand that consumer preferences are independent of the prices and income. You can prefer a Bentley over a Toyota despite the fact that you cannot afford a Bentley. It is the consumer choice that determines what you buy based on your preferences and your budget. There are two YouTube Videos associated with this chapter: Consumer Theory and Derivation of the Demand Function: This video covers the theoretical aspects association with consumer theory and the derivation of the demand function. Consumer Theory: Applications "],["budget-constraint.html", "3.1 Budget Constraint", " 3.1 Budget Constraint A budget constraint represents all combinations of products that can be purchased for a fixed amount. All our examples in this section will be based on two goods, e.g., x and y. Of course, there are many more goods out there but two goods are all that are necessary to explain the main concepts. In this case, the budget constraint is written as: \\[B = P_x \\cdot Q_x + P_y \\cdot Q_y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad Q_y = \\frac{B}{P_y}-\\frac{P_x}{P_y} \\cdot Q_x\\] A change in income results in a shift of the budget line but the slope remains the same. If prices change, the budget line rotates and the slope changes. To illustrate those concepts, consider the following situations: Situation 1: \\(B=100\\), \\(P_x=10\\), and \\(P_y=5\\) \\[100 = 10 \\cdot Q_x + 5 \\cdot Q_y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad Q_y = \\frac{100-10 \\cdot Q_x}{5} = 20 - 2 \\cdot Q_x\\] Situation 2: \\(B=150\\), \\(P_x=10\\), and \\(P_y=5\\) \\[150 = 10 \\cdot Q_x + 5 \\cdot Q_y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad Q_y = \\frac{150-10 \\cdot Q_x}{5} = 30 - 2 \\cdot Q_x\\] Situation 3: \\(B=100\\), \\(P_x=10\\), and \\(P_y=10\\) \\[100 = 10 \\cdot Q_x + 10 \\cdot Q_y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad Q_y = \\frac{100-10 \\cdot Q_x}{10} = 10 - Q_x\\] Those changes are represented in the figure below. Figure 3.1: Changes in the budget constraint due to changes in income and price. If the income changes, the budget constraint shifts parallel as depicted in Panel (a). A change in price results in a different slope as depicted in Panel (b). A budget constraint is linear only if there is no price change over the range. If there are restrictions on what can be bought, e.g., food stamps or quantity discounts, the budget constraint is not linear anymore. To illustrate this point, draw the budget constraints for the following situations: \\(M = 100\\), \\(P_y=2\\), and \\(P_x =4\\) \\(M = 100\\), \\(P_y=2\\), and \\(P_x =4\\) if less than 10 units are bought and \\(P_x=3\\) for units after 10. \\(M = 100\\), \\(P_y=2\\), and \\(P_x =4\\) if less than 10 units are bought and \\(P_x=3\\) on all units if more than 10 are bought. "],["consumer-preferences.html", "3.2 Consumer Preferences", " 3.2 Consumer Preferences Before moving to consumer preference, consider below a 3-D representation of Mount Saint Helens in Panel (a) of the figure below. In consumer theory, the height of the mountain will represent the utility and the contour lines will represent the indifference curves. Figure 3.2: (a) Three-dimensional representation of Mount Saint Helens and contour lines. (b) Graphical representation of utility derived from various bundles of goods and services Consumer theory makes the following assumptions about preferences: Completeness: Given two consumption bundles A and B, the consumer can make one of the following comparisons: (1) A is preferred to B, (2) B is preferred to A, or (3) A is indifferent to B. Transitivity: Given three consumption bundles A, B, and C and if a consumer prefers A to B and B to C, then the consumer also prefers A to C. For example, if a consumers prefers a BMW to a Toyota and a Toyota to a Chevrolet, then the consumer also prefers to BMW to Chevrolet. Non-satiation: More is better than less, i.e., utility does not decrease if more goods are consumed by the consumer. Diminishing marginal utility: The more of a good is already consumed, the smaller the additional utility gained. 3.2.1 Utility Functions These assumptions in the previous section lead us to the concept of utility. Utility is the satisfaction a consumer gets from consuming a good or undertaking an activity. Utility can be either ordinal or cardinal. Ordinal utility is only concerned about the rank ordering of preferences, e.g., A is better than B. Cardinal utility measures the intensity of preferences, e.g., A is twice as good as B. In this class, we only care about ordinal utility. Note that we cannot make interpersonal comparisons of utility. At the end of this chapter, we present a method to make comparisons between consumers. Also, utility is independent of income and does not depend on the price of the product! The change in utility from one more unit consumed is called the marginal utility. Marginal utility diminishes as you consume more of a good (the fifth ice cream cone is not as desirable as the first one). This is called the law of diminishing marginal utility. As long as the marginal utility is positive, total utility will increase. Figure 3.3: Univariate utility function and corresponding marginal utility Note that the assumption of non-satiation which was presented previously comes into play here. Since economics is about allocating scarce resources, i.e., asking what choices people make when faced with limited resources, looking at utility for a single good is not enough. We want to compare utility for different combinations of two or more goods. Consider the following table which represents the levels of utility associated with the consumption of milk and apples. Apples Milk 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 25 36 46 55 63 70 76 81 85 88 2 37 48 58 67 75 82 88 93 97 100 3 47 58 68 77 85 92 98 103 107 110 4 55 66 76 85 93 100 106 111 115 118 5 62 73 83 92 100 107 113 118 122 125 6 68 79 89 98 106 113 119 124 128 131 7 73 84 94 103 111 118 124 129 133 136 8 77 88 98 107 115 122 128 133 137 140 9 79 90 100 109 117 124 130 135 139 142 10 80 91 101 110 118 125 131 136 140 143 3.2.2 Indifference Curves Indifference curves are all combinations of two goods that make the consumer equally well off and are the contour lines associated with the utility function. Those indifference curves can be represented using an indifference map. A point on a higher indifference curve is preferred to any point on a lower curve. Suppose a utility function of the form \\[U = x^{0.75} \\cdot y^{0.25}\\] where U represents the utility and x and y represent the two goods. Solve the utility function for y. You should get \\[y=\\frac{U^4}{x^3}\\] This is a function of the form \\(y=f(x,U)\\). To get a particular indifference curve for a given level of utility, we fix U. If you fix \\(\\bar{U}\\) to say 2, you get the indifference curve because you have a function in x and y only. There are several important properties associated with indifference curves: Indifference curves do not intersect. Indifference curves slope downward. Indifference curves bend inward (are convex to the origin). Let us consider an example in the 2-good space. We will be able to identify 3 regions: (1) Not preferred, (2) Preferred, and (3) Potentially indifferent. "],["consumer-choice.html", "3.3 Consumer Choice", " 3.3 Consumer Choice Consumer maximize their utility subject to the budget constraint they face. Note that the slope of the budget constraint is \\[\\frac{\\Delta q_y}{\\Delta q_x} = -\\frac{p_x}{p_y}\\] The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is the slope of the indifference curve: \\[MRS_{x,y} = -\\frac{\\Delta q_y}{\\Delta q_x} \\bigg \\vert_{\\Delta U = 0}\\] So the optimality condition, i.e., optimal choice is \\[MRS_{x,y} = \\frac{p_x}{p_y}\\] "],["derivation-of-the-demand-curve.html", "3.4 Derivation of the Demand Curve", " 3.4 Derivation of the Demand Curve Remember that the goal of utility theory is to derive the demand function of a product. The figure below illustrates the derivation of the demand function for good x for two examples of utility functions that are used frequently in economics: The Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) and the Cobb-Douglas utility functions. If we start out with the optimal choice given initial prices for both goods and the optimal choice (the point where the indifference curve is tangent to the budget constraint), we have the consumption of x for a particular price \\(p_x\\). If we start to increase the price, the original consumption bundle will to be achievable anymore and the consumer has to choose a new consumption point given the new price for \\(p_x\\). This gives us a second point of the demand curve. If we continue this process, we can trace out the entire demand function for x for all prices. Figure 3.4: Derivation of the demand curve To obtain the market demand for a good, the individual demand functions have to be added horizontally. For example, consider three consumers with the following demand functions: \\(Q_1 = 10-2 \\cdot P\\), \\(Q_2 = 24-3 \\cdot P\\), and \\(Q_3 = 15-P\\). The inverse demand functions can be written as: \\[P = 5-\\frac{Q_1}{2}\\\\ P = 8-\\frac{Q_2}{3}\\\\ P = 15-Q_3\\] The inverse demand functions are valid \\(Q_1 \\in [0,10]\\), \\(Q_2 \\in [0,24]\\), and \\(Q_3 \\in [0,15]\\).

Currently, she purchases this services 20 times a month. Her income is $1,000 per month and the meals cost $20 per meal. All other goods cost $10 per unit. A new online service offers similar meals but charges a flat fee of $200 per month plus $10 per meal. This package lets her consume the same amount of food. However, because the slope of the budget constraint is different, the initial choice is not optimal anymore. By reallocating her consumption, she can get on a higher indifference curve. Panel ``Food Delivery in Figure . Figure 3.6: Theoretical examples about individual choice. Panel (a) demonstrates the switch from a per-unit purchasing system to a scheme which has a fixed cost and a lower per-unit price for subsequent purchases. Panel (b) contrasts the difference between a lump-sum tax and a per-unit tax. Policy Example of a Lump-Sum Tax versus a Per-Unit Tax: A per-unit tax is the institution of an excise tax on some (but not all) goods a consumer purchases. A lump-sum tax is the collection of a single sum, independent of the consumers choices. Assume the following notation: \\(p_x\\) and \\(p_y\\) as the price of goods \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), \\(M\\) as the income, \\(t\\) as the per-unit tax, \\(T\\) as the lump-sum tax. Table and panel ``Lump-Sum vs. Per-Unit Tax in Figure represent this problem. The graph in figure is based on the following parameters: \\(M = 100\\) (income), \\(P_x = 3\\), \\(P_y = 2\\), \\(t = 3\\) (per unit tax), and the utility function is written as \\(U(x,y) = Q_x^a \\cdot Q_y^{1-a}\\) with \\(a=0.4\\).\\ Budget line Choice Original \\(P_x \\cdot Q_x + P_y \\cdot Q_y = M\\) (\\(x_1^\\star,y_1^\\star\\)) Per-unit \\((P_x + t) \\cdot Q_x + P_y \\cdot Q_y = M\\) (\\(x_2^\\star,y_2^\\star\\)) Lump-sum \\(P_x \\cdot Q_x + P_y \\cdot Q_y = M-T\\) (\\(x_3^\\star,y_3^\\star\\)) Subsidy for Low-Income Housing: Suppose you have to decide how to subsidize low-income housing. Assume that the family has an income of $1000 and that the price of other goods is $1. There are two subsidy plans: (1) a dollar-for-dollar subsidy or (2) a lump-sum payment. The initial consumption on housing is $500 ($250 from personal income and $250 subsidy from government). How does this differ from food stamps? 3.5.2 Policy Examples In economics, we assume that all consumers are rational agents who have all the information they need to make informed decisions. This may not always be true even in every-day situations as illustrated in the first three examples. On the other hand, the law of diminishing marginal utility may have some practical implications as demonstrated in the last example below. Consumer Rationality: Burson et al. (2009) demonstrate how people reverse their preferences if faced with numbers that are scaled differently. In their experiment, they have respondents choose a cell phone plan. Under condition 1, 31% favor A and 53% favor B. Under condition 2, 69% favor A and 23% favor B.

Their argument is based on the observation that in some countries, caloric intake decreases while real income increases. Instead of measuring the number of calories consumed, researchers and policy makers should turn to measure the amount of staples such as rice and millet consumed. Both goods are low cost sources of calories and thus, people consuming a large share of their total calories from those foods are likely to be malnourished. Consuming those foods results in a significant increase in utility very quickly and very cheaply. The authors in the article use the term staple calorie share as a measure of undernourishment. Automatic Bill Payment and Electricity Consumption Sexton (2015) shows that enrollment in automatic bill payment (ABP) increases residential and commercial electricity consumption by up to 4.0% and 8.1% respectively.

How many tablespoons are used for her breakfast each morning? Revealed Preferences: To better understand preferences, researchers often present respondents with different price and income situations and ask them to choose between various consumption bundles (see Grebitus and Dumortier (2016) for an example). Consider the following two situations: Situation 1: Income is $100 and prices are \\(p_x=\\$10\\) and \\(p_y=\\$20\\). In this situation, the respondent has the choice between two bundles: Either bundle A with \\(Q^A_x=2\\) and \\(Q^A_y=4\\) or bundle B with \\(Q^B_x=4\\) and \\(Q^B_y=3\\). The consumer picks bundle A. Situation 2: Income is $80 and prices are \\(p_x=\\$20\\) and \\(p_y=\\$10\\). In this situation, the respondent has the choice between two bundles: Either bundle C with \\(Q^C_x=1\\) and \\(Q^C_y=6\\) or bundle A with \\(Q^A_x=2\\) and \\(Q^A_y=4\\).

Textbook Gift Voucher: Tom is in college and receives $500 from his parents each semester to spend on textbooks and other goods. The price of books is $20 and the price of other goods is $10. Assume that the number of textbooks is a choice. In the initial situation, Tom purchases six text books and the rest is spend on other goods. Draw Toms budget constraint and the indifference curve indicating the optimal choice. To ensure that Tom spends sufficient amounts of money on textbooks, his parents replace the cash payment of $500 with a bookstore gift certificate of $300 and $300 in cash. Draw the budget constraint under the new regime. Is Tom better off? On a new graph, draw a situation under which he is better off with a cash payment from his parents of $600 than the $300 cash/$300 gift certificate split. Obesity in Pawnee: Because of rampant obesity in Pawnee, the city government decides to tax candy. In the figure below, you have the original budget constraint with the optimal choice in the absence of any tax. The income of the consumer is $100, the price of candy is $2 per unit, and the price of other goods is $1 per unit. Without the tax, consumers buy 20 units of candy and 60 units of other goods. With the tax of $2 per unit, the consumer buys 10 units of candy and 60 units of other goods. How much does the city government collect in taxes? Assume that political pressure forces the city government to return the amount of the tax collected to the consumer in form of a lump-sum payment at the end of the year.

However, you cannot exceed $600 for hotel and $400 for meals. Assume that everywhere you travel, the price for one night in a hotel is $100 and the price of one meal is $20. Assume that you always exhaust your budget for traveling. Draw the budget constraint for this problem with hotel on the horizontal axis and meals on the vertical axis. Explain to your boss why you would (most likely) be better off with $1,000 but no restrictions on spending. Draw the relevant indifference curves. Church Roof: Philip is a rich atheist but has a soft spot for the leaking roof of his hometown church. The church currently spends $2,000 on the roof and $8,000 on other activities.

Assuming utility maximization of the church, draw the indifference curve corresponding to the current situation. Philip offers the church a $1,000 grant with the constraint that the money can only go towards roof repairs. Put differently, it cannot be used for other activities.

Gasoline in Iran: The Iranian government has provided substantial subsides on gasoline to its citizens in past decades. After international sanctions were imposed on the country due to its suspect nuclear program, those subsidies where not sustainable in the long-run from a financial perspective. Thus Iran eliminated the subsidies but replaced them with a cash transfer to ease the financial burden for its citizens. Assume that gasoline is on the horizontal axis and all other goods are on the vertical axis. The price of other goods does not change throughout the question. Draw the initial budget constraint and the optimal consumption bundle. Assume that both goods are initially consumed. How does the budget constraint change if the government eliminates subsidies on gasoline and the price of gasoline increase subsequently? Show this effect in the graph. Given the new prices, the government provides a subsidy that raises income such that the consumers are as happy as before. Illustrate in your graph.

A production function indicates the maximum amount of output a firm can produce over some period of time from each combination of inputs. Inputs can be hours of labor, $ of capital, cubic feet of natural gas, or tons of raw material. There are similarities between consumer theory and producer theory: Preferences \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) Production technology Budget constraint \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) Cost constraints Consumption choices \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) Production choices Indifference curves and budget lines become isoquants and isocost lines Production functions can be thought of in a very broad context, e.g., studying for an exam or running a 100 meter world record (9.58 seconds). Consider Panel (a) Fertilizer Application in the figure below. In the graph, we have yield as a function of nitrogen application: \\(y = f(N)\\). This application could be of interest if you consider the cost associated with water quality and water treatment plants, e.g., Eagle Creek.

Panel (b) on the right illustrates the concept of inefficient and unattainable production points. "],["production-in-the-short--and-long-run.html", "4.2 Production in the Short- and Long-Run", " 4.2 Production in the Short- and Long-Run In producer theory, we differentiate between the short-run and the long-run. In the short-run, some inputs cannot be adjusted and they are so-called fixed inputs. Examples of fixed inputs are machinery and factories. We classify fixed input as capital (\\(K\\)). The short-run production function is written as \\(q = f(\\bar{K},L)\\). The long-run is a time horizon long enough for a firm to vary all of its inputs. Variable inputs can be adjusted up or down as the quantity of output changes. Consider production in the short run with labor (\\(L\\)) as the only input. The total product is the maximum quantity of output that can be produced from a given combination of inputs. The marginal product of labor is the additional output produced if one more worker is hired, i.e., \\[MPL= \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta L}\\] And the average product is defined as the average quantity per worker \\[AP= \\frac{Q}{ L}\\] The law of diminishing marginal product says that as more and more of any input is added to a fixed amount of other inputs, its marginal product will eventually decline. Note that for low inputs, we can have an increasing marginal product to labor, i.e., MPL increases as more labor is hired. But in most cases, we are faced with diminishing marginal product of labor. Examples that you find in everyday life are studying for an exam or training for a marathon. Returns to scale can be either constant, increasing, or decreasing. Constant returns to scale: \\(t \\cdot f(x) = f(t \\cdot x)\\) Increasing returns to scale: \\(t \\cdot f(x) &lt; f(t \\cdot x)\\) Decreasing returns to scale: \\(t \\cdot f(x) &gt; f(t \\cdot x)\\) The figure below illustrates the relationship between production function, average product, and marginal product. The production function depicted also exhibits increasing marginal product due to specialization at the beginning and then decreasing marginal returns. Figure 4.2: Relationship between production function, average product, and marginal product The more interesting case is production in the long-run where all inputs are variable. So in this section, we consider the inputs labor (\\(L\\)) and capital (\\(K\\)). The figure below shows a so-called Cobb-Douglas production function for the case of two inputs. Figure 4.3: Production function with two inputs. The Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution (MRTS) is the rate at which a firm can substitute one input for another while keeping output constant. The MRTS decreases as we move rightward along an isoquant. It is also the slope of the isoquant. \\[MRTS=-\\frac{\\Delta K}{\\Delta L}=\\frac{MP_L}{MP_K}\\] Recall that \\[MP_K = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta K} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad MP_L = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{\\Delta L}\\] Every firm wants to minimize its costs: \\[C = p_L \\cdot L + p_K \\cdot K \\\\ TC = w \\cdot L + w \\cdot K \\\\ K = \\frac{TC}{r} - \\frac{w}{r} \\cdot L\\] The optimal choice is the point where an isocost line is tangent to the isoquant for that output level \\[MRTS= -\\frac{\\Delta K}{\\Delta L} = \\frac{p_L}{p_K}\\\\ \\frac{MP_L}{p_L} = \\frac{MP_K}{P_K}\\] For any number of inputs: The marginal product per dollar of any input will be equal to the marginal product per dollar of any other input.

In the figure below, you will see two isoquant curves and a point indicating the initial (optimal) combination of workers and the train. The input prices remain unchanged throughout the question. Sketch the corresponding isocost line through the initial, optimal point. Assume that the machinery is fixed at 600 horse power and cannot be changed in the short-run. Due to changed demand, you need to expand production to the higher isoquant line. Show the new isocost line? Is it optimal? If yes, why? If no, why not? You are now able to adjust workers and machinery in the long-run while staying on the higher isoquant curve. What is the effect on cost? What is the effect on the optimal input combination.

The short-run is a time period during which at least one of the firms inputs is fixed. Fixed inputs cannot be adjusted as output changes in the short-run. The short-run production function is written as \\(Q=f(\\bar{K},L)\\). The long-run is a time horizon long enough for a firm to vary all of its inputs depending on changes in output quantities and/or input prices. Consider the example of Southwest Airlines compared to other major carriers. Southwest only operates one type of airplane, i.e., Boeing 737. Other carriers use a wide variety of airplane models. The advantage of using only one airplane model is reduced cost in training and operation. The disadvantage is no flexibility when it comes to serving routes with smaller or larger airplanes depending on demand. In our context, the number and types of airplanes as an input in the production process of transportation is fixed. You can only adjust the number of flights (e.g., lowering or increasing the number of flight personnel) in the short-run.

Consider Al who owns a shoe store. In a given year, he sells shoes valued at $250,000 and the cost to purchase those shoes at the wholesale level is $200,000. From an accounting perspective, the store makes an accounting profit of $50,000. Now suppose that Al could instead be working in a shoe store at the mall making $60,000. This salary is considered the opportunity cost of owing his own store. Thus, the economic profit is the accounting profit minus the opportunity cost, i.e., $50,000-$60,000=-$10,000. If the salary for the position at the mall was only $40,000 then he would make a positive economic profit of $10,000.

Fixed costs are independent of output and need to be paid even if the firm does not produce anything, i.e., \\(Q=0\\). For example, if you have rented space for your coffee shop, then rent is due even if you are not selling any coffee. The same is true if you are an airline and all your planes are grounded due to a pandemic, then you still have to pay the interest for the financing of your planes. As opposed to fixed cost, variable cost vary with output. The variable cost of a coffee shop would be coffee beans and milk. If your output is zero then your variable costs are zero as well. Hence we can define total cost (\\(TC\\)) as total fixed cost (\\(TFC\\)) plus total variable cost (\\(TVC\\)). Given the definition of total, fixed, and variable costs, we have the following cost relations: Average Fixed Cost (AFC): \\[AFC=\\frac{TFC}{Q}\\] Average Variable Cost (AVC): \\[AVC=\\frac{TVC}{Q}\\] Average Cost (AC): \\[AC=\\frac{TC}{Q}=AFC+AVC\\] Marginal Cost (MC): \\[MC= \\frac{\\Delta TC}{\\Delta Q}\\] Consider a total cost function of the following form: \\[C(Q)=450+100 \\cdot Q-3 \\cdot Q^2+0.2 \\cdot Q^3\\] The fixed cost for this cost function is $450.

With PWYW and charity, photo revenue was $6224.22. the lost revenue was achieved with PWYW at $2175.80. The marginal cost of printing the photo is probably very close to zero for the amusement park company. Thus, the profit margin per photo can be relatively high.

Production and Cost Function Relationship: This question will make you show the connection between the production function and the cost function. It will also visualize the marginal and average product of labor. The homework must be done in Excel. Be sure to use the functions available in Excel to make your life easy. Especially the use of $ to keep referencing a particular cell. Except for the input of labor and/or capital columns, every other column should be based on a function starting with =. For your Excel file, make sure that the sheets, tables, and graphs look neat and presentable. The polynomial production function first rises at an increasing rate and then increases at a decreasing rate. That is, the marginal product of labor is first increasing due to specialization and then decreasing. The function you will be looking at is written as: \\[Q = a \\cdot L + b \\cdot L^2 +c \\cdot L^3\\] where Q represents the output quantity and L represents the labor input. The parameters of the function are a, b, and c. In our case, we will define \\(a=10\\), \\(b=20\\), and \\(c=-0.6\\). Open an empty Excel spreadsheet and name the sheet Poly Function. Write a= in cell A1, b= in cell A2, and c= in cell A3. Put the values of 10, 20, and -0.6 in cells B1, B2, and B3, respectively. Assume that the wage \\(w\\) is 10 per unit of L and that the fixed costs are 100. Put w= and FC= in cells C1 and C2, respectively. Put 10 and 100 in cells D1 and D2, respectively. Put the following labels in cells A4 through G4: \\(L\\), \\(Q\\), \\(MPL\\), \\(APL\\), \\(FC\\), \\(VC\\), and \\(TC\\). Those columns represent the units of labor, the output quantity, the marginal product of labor, the average product of labor, the fixed costs, the variable cost, and the total cost. Put 0 in cells A5, 0.25 in cell A6, until you reach 20 in cell A85 (Once you have the first two values, simply mark both and drag them down until cell A85.). Now, you have all the information you need to fill out the columns for \\(Q\\), \\(MPL\\), \\(APL\\), \\(FC\\), \\(VC\\), and \\(TC\\). In three new sheets, I want you to graph your results.

Be careful with the cost function, it should not be a linear line! Use the scatter plot function of Excel. Cobb-Douglas Production Function: A Cobb-Douglas production function is used very often in economics because its functional form is very flexible. In general it is written as follows: \\[Q = A \\cdot K^\\alpha \\cdot L^\\beta\\] Create a new sheet called Cobb Douglas and type in the following information regarding parameters: A1 to A4: K Fixed, alpha, beta, A. B1 to B4: 9, 0.5 0.3, 10 C1 to C2: w, r D1 to D2: 0.5, 0.2 In cells A5 through H5, put the following labels: Q, Kfixed, L, Q, MPL, APL, FC, VC, and TC. Ranging from 0 to 10 in increments of 0.1, put the units of labor in cells C6 through C106. Then fill in the remaining columns. In three new sheets, I want you to graph your results.

Multi-Plant Production: In class, we have considered producing with one production facility only. Our analysis and results (e.g., price equals marginal cost) is easily extendable to multiple production facilities. Assume that you are a producer who has two production plants. You incur no fixed cost for running both plants and only face variable costs. The total cost for the plant 1 (\\(TC_1\\)) and 2 (\\(TC_2\\)) are \\(TC_1(Q_1) = 2 \\cdot Q_1^3\\) and \\(TC_2(Q_2) = Q_2^2\\). The marginal cost is written as \\(MC_1 = 6 \\cdot Q_1^2\\) and \\(MC_2 = 2 \\cdot Q_2\\). In Excel, write Q in cell A1 and write \\(0,0.1,\\dots,5\\) in cells A2 to A52 (do not enter those numbers manually but make sure to just drag the little square down).

Fill in the production quantities in cells A3 to A28 ranging from 0 to 25 in increments of 1. Fill in the marginal cost, average total cost, average variable cost, revenue, profit, and price columns. Make the make the revenue, profit, and price columns a function of cell B1. Once you have filled out the table, I want you to create three new sheets: (1) Sheet Profit: A graph that displays the profit as a function of the quantity produced, (2) Sheet Cost and Revenue: A graph that displays cost and revenue as a function of quantity, and (3) Sheet MC and AC: A graph that displays MC, ATC, AVC, and price. Once you have done this, you can play around with the price by changing cell B1, i.e., the price, and see how profit and output decisions change. "],["demand-and-supply.html", "6 Demand and Supply", " 6 Demand and Supply We derived the demand and supply function for a good in the previous two sections on consumer and producer theory. In this chapter, we determine the market equilibrium and analyze how the market equilibrium evolves under shifting supply and demand. If the market is not in equilibrium, we call this a market imbalance. In the case of excess supply, the price is above the equilibrium. In the case of excess demand, the price is below the equilibrium. "],["demand-curve.html", "6.1 Demand Curve", " 6.1 Demand Curve The quantity demanded of a good or service is the number of units that all buyers in a market would choose to buy over a given time period, given the constraints that they face. There is a negative relationship between price and quantity demanded as shown in consumer theory. The demand curve is a function of price (\\(p\\)), price of substitutes (\\(p_S\\)), price of complements (\\(p_C\\)), income (\\(I\\)), and possibly other factors such as advertising, tastes, taxes, weather, etc. Hence, the demand curve is usually expressed as a function \\(Q^d=f(p,p_S,p_C,I,\\dots)\\) Substitutes are goods that are similar to each other and can serve as an alternative for a good. Examples for substitutes are maple syrup, honey, sugar, jam. Complements are goods that are bought together. Examples of complements are pancake mix and maple syrup or cars and tires. The demand function is usually represented as a function form. For example the demand for natural gas as a function of price (\\(P\\)) and temperature (\\(T\\)): \\[Q^d=200-4 \\cdot P-\\frac{T}{2}\\] Given the functional form, the demand can then be either represented in a table format or as a graph. For example, given the above demand for natural gas, you can draw the demand if the temperature is say \\(T=80\\) or \\(T=20\\). The law of demand states that when the price of a good rises and everything else remaining the same, the quantity demanded of the good will fall. In economics, everything else remains the same is called ceteris paribus. A change in any variable that affects demand, except for the goods price, causes the demand curve to shift. There is a difference between change in quantity demanded and change in demand. It is important to differentiate between a shift in demand and a price change. In the case of a price change, we have Price decrease \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Movement to the right along the curve Price increase \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Movement to the left along the curve Some important factors that make the demand curve shift are: Income or wealth: An increase (decrease) in income or wealth shifts the demand function to the right (left). Price of substitutes: An increase (decrease) in the price of substitutes shifts the demand function to the right (left). Price of complements: An increase (decrease) in the price of complements the demand function to the left (right). Population: An increase (decrease) in population shifts the demand function to the right (left). Expected price: An increase (decrease) in the expected price shifts the demand function to the right (left).

Very often the discussion centers around whether a price increase results in an increase or decrease in revenue. An argument can be made for both cases.

The article states that In just about every state that increased beer taxes in recent years, teenage drinking soon dropped. The same happened in the early 1990s when Arizona, Maryland, New Jersey and a handful of other states passed zero-tolerance laws, which suspend the licenses of under-21 drivers who have any trace of alcohol in their blood. In states that waited until the late 90s to adopt zero tolerance, like Colorado, Indiana and South Carolina, the decline generally did not happen until after the law was in place.

Feeling a Drought: The following is an extract of an article title Supply shocks: Feeling a drought from the British news magazine The Economist. Read the paragraph and answer the question below. Much of Americas agricultural heartland is in the grips of extreme to exceptional drought. It is becoming increasingly clear that this drought will take a significant toll on some of the nations principal food crops, especially corn, wheat, and soybeans. As a result, food prices are soaring - the price of corn rose 23% in July - and those food price increases are beginning to make their way into official inflation figures. This morning, the Bureau of Labour Statistics released its July producer price index. Headline prices for finished goods rose 0.3% for the month, above expectations. The internals of the report show a sharp division between food price trends and the movement of prices for most other goods. Finished core prices rose a strong 0.4% to 0.5% for finished foods. But core prices for intermediate and crude goods actually fell in July, while intermediate and crude food indexes soared. Prices for crude food stuffs rose by 5.2% in July alone. The impact of the drought on production is quite clearly a supply shock; productive capacity has actually been diminished and prices have risen as a result. Other things equal, the economy will grow a bit less than expected before the scope of the drought became clear and inflation will be a bit higher. Corn is a significant input to the production of meat because a high proportion of livestock feed uses corn. I want you to draw two supply and demand graphs (i.e., two markets): One for corn and one for meat. Illustrate the effects of the drought on the market for corn and how this translates into the market for meat. War on Drugs: Concerned about the high consumption of illegal, highly addictive drugs in the state, the governor solicits ideas to address the problem. State Representative Carson, a hardliner on drugs, suggests that the police should focus on reducing the number of drug dealers in the state.

To answer the question, assume that both proposals work in reality and have the desired effects. Using two supply and demand graphs for the drug market (i.e., one for each representative), illustrate the effects of the two proposals. Assume that the market for drugs is initially in equilibrium. Then proceed to show the effects of the policy proposals. Based on your analysis, which policy would you recommend? Why? "],["perfect-competition.html", "7 Perfect Competition", " 7 Perfect Competition Perfect competition is characterized by many buyers and many sellers in the market. All market participants are price taking agent, i.e., everyone takes the price prevailing in the market as given. Examples for perfectly competitive markets are agriculture, restaurant business, standardized products (e.g., office supplies), or unskilled labor market. The opposite case is a monopoly where we have a market with many buyers but only one seller. The monopoly is characterized by price-setting behavior. Examples are De Beers, IUPUI parking system, or the Bombardier 415 Superscooper. The third market structure that we are going to analyze in this course is the most common one: an oligopoly. In an oligopoly, we have many buyers but only a ``handful of sellers. Examples are Airbus and Boeing, or car manufacturers. Some oligopolies are not as well known as other such as the industry composed of BHP Billiton ($66b), Rio Tinto ($51b), Vale ($44b), Glencore ($232b), (compare to GM ($155b) and Lilly ($23b)). Other market structures include monopsonies (one buyer many sellers) and oligopsonies (few buyers and many sellers). Examples are defense contracts (Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Airbus) or Walmart in the case of monopsonies. As aforementioned, perfectly competitive markets are characterized by price-taking behavior. Individual economic agent cannot influence the price and hence, there is a nonstrategic environment. In order for price taking behavior to occur, a large number of buyers and sellers is necessary. Individual firm faces a horizontal demand curve, i.e., perfectly elastic, at the market price. One assumption that is usually made is that products are homogenous, i.e., all the products are the same such as T-shirts, wheat, etc. We will see later that free entry and exit in and out of the market are important. No entry and exit barriers exist. Under perfect competition: \\(MR = p\\), i.e., an individual firms demand curve is a straight line (perfectly elastic). The firm takes the market price as given and sets \\(p=MC\\) to obtain the profit-maximizing output level, i.e., slides along its MC curve (above average variable cost) with changing output price. Recall how profit and loss can be derived from the marginal and average cost functions based on the price (Figure ). In the short-run, competitive firms can earn economic profit, or suffer an economic loss. The market sums buying and selling preferences of individual consumers and producers, and determines the market price. Each buyer and seller takes market price as given and is able to buy or sell the desired quantity. In the long-run, entry and exit of firms because of profits or losses. This shifts the market supply curve and changes the market price. Positive economic profit attracts new entrants until economic (not accounting!) profit is zero. This is called the zero economic profit condition in the long-run. Before turning to the Zero Economic Profit Condition, let us first consider the First Welfare Theorem. Under certain conditions, decentralized markets maximize total surplus for society, leaving no possible way for anyone to change the situation and make someone better off without making anyone else worse off. The invisible hand by Adam Smith refers to the information contained in prices and the self-interest by the market participants. The following is a quote from An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith (1723-1790): It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages. Note that the first welfare theorem contains the expression ``under certain conditions. The necessary conditions are: No policies that distort prices, e.g., taxes, subsidies, price floors/ceilings, in a perfectly competitive market. No market power such as in monopolies and oligopolies exist. No externalities. Externalities can be either negative, e.g., pollution, or positive, e.g., recreational amenities.

In the case of a subsidy, there is an increase in the equilibrium quantity, a decrease in the price by consumers, and an increase in the price received by producers. The incidence of the subsidy is identical to the tax case. Figure 7.3: Consumer and producer taxes example (Panels (a) and (b). Effect on tax burden under inelastic demand (Panel (c)) and elastic demand (Panel (d)). Imposing a per-unit tax on either the consumer or the producer results in the same outcome. Assume that the demand is written as \\[Q^D=10-2 \\cdot P\\] and the supply is written as \\[q^s = 2 \\cdot p - 2\\] Without any taxes, this results in a market equilibrium: \\[10 - 2 \\cdot p = 2 \\cdot p - 2\\\\ \\Rightarrow p^\\ast = 3\\\\ \\Rightarrow q^\\ast = 4\\] Now assume that we impose a tax on the producer. The price received by the producer is now \\(p-t\\), i.e., supply is written as \\(q^s = 2 \\cdot (p-t) - 2\\). And the resulting market equilibrium \\[10 - 2 \\cdot p = 2 \\cdot (p-t) - 2\\\\ \\Rightarrow p^\\ast = 3+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot t\\\\ \\Rightarrow q^\\ast = 4-t\\] If \\(t=1\\), the consumer pays \\(p^d =\\$3.50\\) and the producer receives \\(p^s =\\$2.50\\). The equilibrium quantity is \\(q^\\ast=3\\). If the tax is imposed on the consumer, the consumer pays \\(p+t\\) and demand is written as \\(q^d = 10 - 2 \\cdot (p+t)\\). The resulting market equilibrium \\[10 - 2 \\cdot (p+t) = 2 \\cdot p - 2\\\\ \\Rightarrow p^\\ast = 3-\\frac{t}{2}\\\\ \\Rightarrow q^\\ast = 4-t\\] If \\(t=1\\), the consumer pays \\(p^d =\\$3.50\\) and the producer receives \\(p^s =\\$2.50\\). This is equivalent to the producer tax scenario. The equilibrium quantity is \\(q^\\ast=3\\). Consider the equilibrium quantity as a function of the tax rate, i.e., \\(q^\\ast = 4-t\\). This function also determine the tax revenue (\\(l\\)) for the government as a function of \\(t\\), i.e., \\(l=t(4-t)\\). 7.2.2 Price Floors and Price Ceilings A price floor is a minimum legal price mandated in a particular market, making all trades at prices below the price floor illegal. Non-price rationing in the market under price floors to reduce excess supply. Non-price mechanism to ensure supply equals demand; e.g., exit of producers. Non-price rationing by the government under price floors results in the government purchasing any surplus not sold at the price floor. Examples are the minimum wage or price floors for agricultural commodities. Price ceilings are maximum legal price mandated in a particular market, making all trades at prices above the price ceiling illegal.

Under imperfect competition, there is price-setting behavior and individual producers influence the market price.

In general, a monopolist reduces output to raise price. However, to increase the quantity sold, a monopolist must lower the price on each unit sold. Hence, the monopolist makes money on the additional quantity sold but loses money on the quantity that was already selling because there is now a lower price. There are multiple reasons for a monopoly to exit but those are usually related to barriers to enter the market: Economies of scale: One firm can operate at lower average cost than multiple firms and there are decreasing average cost over the entire market range. A natural monopoly can produce for the entire market and/or there may be large sunk cost and/or fixed cost. Legal barriers: Protection of intellectual property (e.g., copyrights, patents), control over a scarce resource, or barriers put in place by firms to discourage entry. Network externalities: Added benefits for all users of a good or service that arise because other people are using it too. Joining a large network is more beneficial than joining a small network. Think about Facebook and LinkedIn. As opposed to perfect competition, there is the possibility of profits in the long-run. It is difficult to find a straightforward example of a monopolist because there are sometimes other aspects (e.g., time and space) to consider as will the following examples illustrate: Microsoft: The software company was often considered a monopolist in the market for operating systems which lead to antitrust law cases in the U.S. (United States of America v. Microsoft Corporation) and the EU (Microsoft Corporation v.

Some residents of Indianapolis have only access to one of the providers which makes it a monopoly in that area despite the fact that it is not a single provider in Indianapolis. Electricity Transmission: The electricity transmission network in the U.S. is owned by many companies. But the system works very much like a road and there can be congestion or closed down roads due to accidents or construction. Thus, it can happen that a particular power transmission company can have a monopoly for a very short period of time if it operates the only open line. The next sections outline that a monopoly is (in general) inefficient, i.e., reduces societal welfare, which is the reason why countries around the world have antitrust laws. Those laws also apply to groups of producers who act as if they were a monopoly. That is the case of a cartel, e.g., Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). There is also the case of a durable good monopoly which is a monopoly creating competition to itself. A durable good does not depreciate once it is on the market. Imagine being the owner of the only gold mine on Earth. At the beginning, this is a monopoly. But given that gold is never really lost, there will soon be a second hand gold market which competes with the initial monopoly. It can be argued that college textbooks create the problem of a durable good monopoly since some of the books do not really depreciate in terms of information presented in them. Thus, textbook publishers are selling new editions to overcome the problem of a durable goods monopoly. 8.1.1 Overview The monopolist sets marginal revenue equal to marginal cost, i.e., MR=MC, in order to find the profit maximizing output quantity. Recall that under perfect competition, we have marginal cost pricing, i.e., p=MC. It is important to understand that a firm in a perfectly competitive market also sets MR=MC but because the price is determined by the market, the marginal revenue from selling an additional unit is p. The difference between a perfectly competitive firm and a monopolist is illustrated in the figure below. Figure 8.1: Under perfect competition as well as under a monopoly situation, the profit maximizing output quantity is determined where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost. The next sections illustrate the monopolists output decision under (1) constant and (2) increasing marginal cost. Note that a monopolistic market results in a deadweight loss. This is not caused by higher prices for consumers or higher profits for the monopolist but by the underproduction of goods. 8.1.2 Constant Marginal Cost Assume a monopolist is faced with a demand that can be written as \\(Q=50-P/2\\). The inverse demand function can thus be written as \\(P=100-2 \\cdot Q\\). The revenue can be written as \\[R = P \\cdot Q = (100-2 \\cdot Q ) \\cdot Q = 100 \\cdot Q - 2 \\cdot Q^2\\] Marginal revenue is written as \\(MR=100-4 \\cdot Q\\). Assume MC=20, then under perfect competition, we have P=MC, i.e., \\(20 = 100-2 \\cdot Q\\). And hence, the socially optimum output quantity is \\(Q_c=20\\). Under monopoly pricing, we have MC=MR, i.e., \\(20 = 100-4 \\cdot Q\\). And hence, the monopoly output quantity is \\(Q_m=20\\). This situation is illustrated in Panel (a) of the figure below. Figure 8.2: Examples of output decisions by a monopolist under constant and increasing marginal cost. 8.1.3 Increasing Marginal Cost Suppose that the cost function is written as \\(C=100+Q^2\\) with increasing marginal cost function \\(MC=2 \\cdot Q\\). If the inverse demand function is written as \\(P=100-2 \\cdot Q\\), then the marginal revenue function is \\(MR=100-4 \\cdot Q\\). Similar to the example with constant marginal cost, we set MR=MC, i.e., \\(100-4 \\cdot Q=2 \\cdot Q\\). Solving leads to \\(Q_m=100/6\\) which is illustrated in Panel (b) of the figure above. Again the quantity chosen by the monopolist is not socially optimal. Lets consider two policies to restore efficiency: Per-unit tax Price ceiling 8.1.4 Monopoly and Elasticity A monopolist produces on the elastic portion of the demand curve. It can be shown that \\[\\underbrace{\\frac{p-MC}{p}}_{\\text{Lerner Index}} = -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_D} \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad p \\cdot \\left(1+\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_D} \\right) = MC\\] The interpretation of the above equation is that the more elastic demand, the higher the availability of substitutes. Markup over marginal cost is reduced if the elasticity becomes larger (see figure below). Figure 8.3: The magnitude of above marginal cost pricing depends on the elasticity of the demand function. "],["price-discrimination.html", "8.2 Price Discrimination", " 8.2 Price Discrimination A single-price monopoly is limited to charging the same price for each unit of output sold. If price discrimination is possible, the monopolist charges different prices to different customers, i.e., the monopolist can divide customers into different categories based on their willingness-to-pay (WTP). The firm must (1) have market power, (2) identify consumers WTP, and (3) prevent low-price customers from reselling to high-price customers in order for price discrimination to be feasible. Price discrimination is always beneficial to producers otherwise they would not charge different prices to different consumers. It can harm consumers because there will be a higher price for some consumers but it also has lower prices for others. The additional producers profit represents a monetary loss to consumers. Examples are movie theaters, buses, trains, airplanes, amusement parks, or restaurants where a difference in prices is based on groups, e.g., students, seniors, children. Price discrimination can also be observed for events such as sport games where season tickets and quantity discounts are offered. There are three types of price discrimination: First Degree: This is also known as perfect price discrimination and is achieved if the marginal revenue curve is equivalent to the demand curve. Second Degree: This is also known as nonlinear pricing and occurs with different types of consumers without observation of type. This results in offering different quantities of the good at different prices. Consumers self-select into a type. Common examples are different classes of service, hobbling a product (restrictions on the use of a device), quantity discounts, and so on. Second Degree: Also known as imperfect price discrimination occurs with different types of consumers with observation of type. Common examples for this type of price discrimination are museum or movie theatre entries with senior or student pricing. "],["oligopoly.html", "8.3 Oligopoly", " 8.3 Oligopoly An oligopoly market is characterized by few sellers, blocked entry and exit, imperfect dissemination of information, and the opportunity for positive economic profits in the long-run. There is a strategic interdependence among the firms that is commonly represented by the Bertrand model, Cournot model or the Stackelberg model. A very powerful approach to model the strategic interaction among firms is game theory which will be covered in the next chapter. The barriers to entry can result from (1) economies of scale or natural oligopoly, (2) reputation, (3) strategic barriers, or (4) legal barriers. In the case of economies of scale, one firm can supply a large part of the market (not all of it) which leads to lower per-unit cost than many small firms. Established oligopolists are likely to have favorable reputation as well. Strategic barriers can result from excess production capacity, market saturation, special contracts with distributors or from long-term arrangements with customers. As with the monopoly, legal barriers such as patents, copyrights, or zoning regulations can occur as well. Oligopoly is a very common market structure. There can be a dominant single firm surrounded by a number of smaller firms (Anheuser-Busch 47% and MillerCoors 30%), three dominant firms (Universal Music Group 39%, Sonic Music Entertainment 30%, and Warner Music Group 19%), duopoly which is an oligopoly with only two sellers (Airbus and Boeing). Examples of less concentrated markets are cereals with Kellogg, General Mills, Post, and Quaker Oats. But there are far more examples such as oil/gasoline, cars, cable/internet, smartphones, textbooks, rental cars, airlines, aluminum etc. at the national level or gasoline, food, and various professional services at the local level. 8.3.1 Measurement of Market Concentration The economic census provides a comprehensive statistical profile of the economy. Industry statistics are classified using the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The main categories are Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting (Code 11), Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction (Code 21), Utilities (Code 22), Construction (Code 23), Manufacturing (Code 31-33), Wholesale Trade (Code 42), Retail Trade (Code 44-45), Transportation and Warehousing (Code 48-49), Information (Code 51), Finance and Insurance (Code 52), Real Estate and Rental and Leasing (Code 53), Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (Code 54), Management of Companies and Enterprises (Code 55), Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services (Code 56), Educational Services (Code 61), Health Care and Social Assistance (Code 62), Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation (Code 71), Accommodation and Food Services (Code 72), Other Services (except Public Administration) (Code 81), Public Administration (Code 92). In the table below, we have data from the 2007 Economic Census for military armored vehicle, tank, and tank component manufacturing (336992), dog and cat food manufacturing (311111), quick printing (323114), ready-mix concrete manufacturing (327320).

The concentration ratio measures the combined market share percentage of the n leading firms: \\[CR_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{{\\text{Firm Sales}}_i}{\\text{Industry Sales}} \\times 100\\] For a monopoly, we have \\(CR_n=100\\) and for a perfectly competitive industry we have \\(CR_n \\approx 0\\), that is, the concentration ratio decreases for many firms. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) is the sum of squared market share percentage for all competitors: \\[ HHI = \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{{\\text{Firm Sales}}_i}{\\text{Industry Sales}} \\times 100 \\right)^2\\] For a monopoly, HHI=10,000 and for a perfectly competitive industry \\(HHI \\approx 0\\). Suppose we have four firms (labeled \\(F_i\\)) in the market and three industries (A, B, and C). The revenues of those firms are presented in the table below: Industry \\(F_1\\) \\(F_2\\) \\(F_3\\) \\(F_4\\) Industry Sales \\(CR_2\\) HHI A 30 30 30 30 120 50 2500 B 84 28 17 11 140 80 4209 C 114 110 36 20 280 80 3417 8.3.2 Cournot, Bertrand, and Stackelberg Models The following models attempt to explain competitive behavior among two or more firms. All three models are relatively old. The Cournot model was published in 1838, the Bertrand model was formulated in 1883, and the Stackelberg model was described in 1934. The Cournot Model assumes that there are two firms in the market producing an identical good. Suppose that the demand is written as follows: \\[P=40-Q=40-Q_1-Q_2\\] where \\(Q_1\\) and \\(Q_2\\) are the output quantities of the two firms. The marginal cost is equal to 2. Each firm i maximizes its profits: \\[\\pi_i = (40-Q_i-Q_j) \\cdot Q_i - 2 \\cdot Q_i = 38 \\cdot Q_i-Q_i^2-Q_i \\cdot Q_j \\] Taking the first order condition and setting it to zero yields: \\[38-2 \\cdot Q_i-Q_j=0\\] And thus, the reaction function is written as: \\[Q_i = 19-\\frac{Q_j}{2}\\] Since the reaction function is the same for both firms, the resulting quantities are \\(Q_1=Q_2=12.67\\) and the price is \\(P=14.67\\). The Bertrand Model assumes that competition between the two firms leads to the perfectly competitive outcomes, i.e., price equals marginal cost. In this case, \\(P=2\\) and \\(Q_1=Q_2=19\\) In the Stackelberg model, the leading firm moves first (i.e., sets the production quantity) and the follower observes the action of the leading firm and decides on output quantity. Assume that the leader is firm 1 and the follower is firm 2. In this case, firm 1 maximizes its profit given the reaction function of firm 2: \\[\\pi_1=\\left(40-Q_1-19+\\frac{Q_1}{2}\\right) \\cdot Q_1-2 \\cdot Q_1=19 \\cdot Q_1-\\frac{Q_1^2}{2}\\] Taking the first order conditions results in \\(19-Q_1=0\\) and thus, we have \\(Q_1=19\\), \\(Q_2=9.5\\), and \\(P=11.5\\). Note that the leading firm is producing more in the Stackelberg Model than the follower. 8.3.3 Cartel and Collusion The previous section on the models developed by Cournot, Bertrand, and Stackelberg illustrates that competition reduces the profits and there is a strategic interaction. There is a way around competition which is highly illegal in all countries: cartels. Here cartels for legal products are considered and not drug cartel which adds a whole different category of legal problems. In a cartel, multiple firms act as if they are a monopolist. In the previous section, the following demand function was considered: \\(P=40-Q\\). The marginal revenue associated with this (inverse) demand function is \\(MR=40-2 \\cdot Q\\). Thus, setting marginal revenue equal to marginal cost (\\(MC=2\\)) leads to a monopolistic production quantity of \\(Q=19\\). Both firms could agree to produce 9.5 units each which would lead to a price of 21. Note that firms do not need to engage in explicit collusion (i.e., direct communication) but can engagne in implicit collusion simply by using a tit-for-tat strategy. Assuming multiple periods, an individual firm could raise prices in one period and see if the other firm follows the signal by raising prices as well. From an economic perspective, cartels are unstable because prices are high and firms can undercut each other. This instability is used by antitrust agencies to destabilize them even more. For example, legislation usually has no penalty for the first firm blowing the whistle on a cartel. The United Potato Growers of America aspires to be to potatoes what OPEC is to oil by carefully managing supply to keep demand high and constant, resulting in a more stable return for farmers. This is how the Wall Street Journal describes the situation in the U.S. potatoes market in This Spuds Not for You: Growing Co-Op of Farmers Seeks to Become OPEC of Potatoes by Controlling Supply. The Capper-Volstead Act exempted farmers from federal antitrust laws which allowed the United Potato Growers of America to destroy 680 million pounds of potatoes in 2005 in order to keep prices high. This increased the price of potatoes by 48.5% which was mostly absorbed by retailers and thus, consumers did not see a large price increase. There has been an issue of overproduction of potatoes which resulted in a decrease of price. Controlling the supply helped stabilize (or increase) the price of potatoes. There have also been allegations that major container shipping lines engage in price-fixing (cartel) behavior. Those charges were dropped though.

"],["game-theory.html", "9 Game Theory", " 9 Game Theory Game theory considers situations where so-called players (people, firms, political parties, animals, etc.) make decisions as strategic reactions to other agents actions. Examples are reality TV shows with people competing against each other, political parties choosing their position on an issue or during an election, or price strategies of firms in a competitive environment. In addition, almost every sport as well as war is based on game theory. The 1983 movie WarGames is an excellent example of applied game theory. In economics, one of the most general problems is outguessing a rival, i.e., a firm seeks to determine its rivals most profitable counter-strategy to its own current policy. Strategic interdependence means that a players welfare is a function of the own action and the actions of other players. The optimal action of a player depends on expectations of what other players will do. This strategic interdependence among agents is called non-cooperative game theory, i.e., binding agreements among agents are not assumed. For example, interaction of two football teams playing a game is non-cooperative. Cooperation may or may not occur among agents as a result of rational decisions, e.g., trigger strategies. For this class, we assume full information, i.e., players are aware of the payoff structure of games. Economic models based on game theory are abstractions from strategic interaction of agents. They allow tractable interactions, yield implications, and allow to draw conclusions that can be used to understand real world strategic interactions. Every game has three components: (1) Finite number of players (at least 2) who are the decision makers, (2) set of action for each player, (3) payoffs that can be ranked at least ordinally. Payoff may be in form of a change in (marginal) utility, revenue, profit, or some nonmonetary change in satisfaction. A players strategy is the complete contingent plan. If it could be written down, any other agent could follow the plan and duplicate players actions. Thus, a strategy is a players course of action involving a set of actions (moves) dependent on actions of other players. A unique equilibrium or a set of equilibria may occur within a set of strategies is called a Nash equilibrium (after mathematician John Nash).Not all games have a Nash equilibrium and some games may have a number of Nash equilibria. In the movie ``A Beautiful Movie, John Nashs discovery is portrayed to have happened in a bar: If we all go for the blonde and block each other, not a single one of us is going to get her. So then we go for her friends, but they will all give us the cold shoulder because no one likes to be second choice. But what if none of us goes for the blonde? We wont get in each others way and we wont insult the other girls. Its the only way to win. Note that the movie is wrong about the Nash Equilibrium. The situation described is not a Nash Equilibrium. "],["single-shot-games.html", "9.1 Single Shot Games", " 9.1 Single Shot Games We now present several classical simultaneous move games that you can find in almost every economics textbook and illustrate different concepts associated with game theory. 9.1.1 Prisoners Dilemma The best-known game is the Prisoners Dilemma. The payoff table for the two players is represented as: Player B Confess Deny Player A Deny 1,1 20,0 Confess 0,20 5,5 In the prisoners dilemma game, there is one Nash Equilibrium. Note that it is not the optimal outcome. Every Nash Equilibrium is characterized as a state where no player has the incentive to deviate. In a game, there can be multiple Nash Equilibria. : 9.1.2 Stag Hunt Consider the following game Player B Stag Hare Player A Stag 2,2 0,1 Hare 1,0 1,1 9.1.3 Up or Down A dominant strategy is a strategy that is preferred to another no matter what other players do. When all players have a dominant strategy, an equilibrium of dominant strategies exists that is determined without a player having to consider behavior of other players. Consider the game : Player B up down Player A up 10,10 7,7 down 7,7 5,5 9.1.4 Rock, Paper, Scissors It is also possible to have a game with no Nash Equilibrium. is an example for such a game: Player B R P S Player A R d,d l,w w,l P w,l d,d l,w S l,w w,l d,d If there is no Nash Equilibrium with a pure strategy, we can resort to a mixed strategy. If you think about how you play rock, paper, scissors, you can imagine what a mixed strategy does: randomize your actions. Consider the game as an example for a mixed strategy: Let us now turn to games that are more specific to economics. Consider a cartel with two firms. Both firms have to decide whether to cheat or comply with the cartel agreement: Player B Dont cheat Cheat Player A Dont cheat 50,50 45,54 Cheat 54,45 48,48 Also in the cartel setting, we can have a situation where a mixed strategy is necessary. Consider as a hypothetical example ``Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi: Player B Dont cheat Cheat Player A Dont cheat 50,50 45,54 Cheat 54,45 48,48 The mixed strategy equilibrium for Pepsi can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation*} 13 \\cdot \\rho + 10 \\cdot (1-\\rho) = 16 \\cdot \\rho + 8 \\cdot (1-\\rho) \\end{equation*}\\] The mixed strategy equilibrium for Coca-Cola can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation*} 12 \\cdot \\lambda + 9 \\cdot (1-\\lambda) = 14 \\cdot \\lambda + 6 \\cdot (1-\\lambda) \\end{equation*}\\] Beach location game ##Repeated Games We have seen that in the single shot prisoners dilemma there is no Nash Equilibrium. It is possible to identify an optimal strategy for an infinitely repeated game. This is called a trigger strategy. In the first round, player \\(A\\) cooperates and does not confess. In every round after, if player \\(B\\) cooperated on previous round, \\(A\\) cooperates. If \\(B\\) defected on previous round, \\(A\\) then defects. Strategy does very well because it offers an immediate punishment for defection and has a forgiving strategy. An application is the carrot-and-stick strategy that underlies most attempts at raising children. Consider the following game between Pepsi and Coca-Cola. Note that one-time win from a low price is 5 and the loss in repeated games is 4 (discount rate becomes important). Player B Dont cheat Cheat Player A Dont cheat 12,12 6,17 Cheat 17,6 8,8 In a sequential, or dynamic, game, one player knows other players choice before she has to make a choice (perfect information). A monopolist can determine consumer demand prior to producing an output, or a buyer knows sticker price on a new automobile before making an offer. Use a technique called backward induction to determine a sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium, by working backward toward the root in a game tree. Once game is understood through backward induction, players play it forward. To apply backward induction, first determine optimal actions at last decision nodes that result in terminal nodes. Then determine optimal actions at next-to-last decision nodes, assuming that optimal actions will follow at next decision nodes. Backward induction implicitly assumes that a players strategy will consist of optimal actions at every node in game tree. Firms who act first have an advantage lead to preemption games. Strategic pre-commitments can affect future payoffs. For example, a firm adopting a relatively large production capacity in a new market can saturate the market and make it difficult for ensuing firms to enter. The ability to seize a market first depends on markets contestability. Governments concerned with ability of firms to saturate a market and forestall entry of other firms have attempted to place restrictions on such behavior.

"],["public-policy.html", "10 Public Policy", " 10 Public Policy The requirements for markets to allocate resources efficiently are (1) that markets exist for all goods and services in the economy, (2) perfect competition, (3) perfect information, (4) property rights are assigned to all resources and commodities, and (5) there are no externalities. In the following sections, we look at cases where those conditions are violated and where public policy can intervene to improve or restore efficiency. "],["externalities.html", "10.1 Externalities", " 10.1 Externalities Externalities are costs (negative externalities) or benefits (positive externalities) on non-market participants. There are no incentives for market participants to take those (social) costs and benefits into account and thus, they base their decisions only on private benefits and costs. Consider the following examples: The manufacturer of cigarettes observes private marginal cost, i.e., the marginal cost of producing cigarettes, but ignores the cost of negative health outcomes that is paid by society. For example, the marginal cost of producing a cigarette may be 3 cents and the marginal external cost of smoking the cigarette may be 2 cents. Thus, the private marginal cost is 3 cents but the social marginal cost is 5 cents. The cigarette manufacturer bases its production decision on 3 cents. A social marginal cost above the private marginal cost is an example of a negative externality. The firms supply curve does not capture all social marginal costs associated with its product. Consider the production of sugary and fatty food and drink items. Producers and consumers of those items do not take the cost into account that the resulting increase in obesity has on non-market participants. The following was published in The Seattle Times on December 21, 2011 under the title As passengers add girth, ferries drop capacity: The Washington state ferry service isnt going to start turning away hefty passengers, but it has had to reduce the capacity of the nations largest ferry system because people have been packing on the pounds. Coast Guard vessel-stability rules that took effect nationwide Dec. 1 raised the estimated weight of the average adult passenger to 185 pounds from the previous 160 pounds, based on population information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). During the past 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in obesity in the United States and about one-third of American adults are now considered obese, the CDC says on its website. The state ferry system has complied with the new stability rules by simply reducing the listed capacity of its vessels, Coast Guard Lt. Eric Young said Wednesday. That has effectively reduced the amount of passengers by about 250 passengers or so depending on the particular ferry, said Young, who is based in Seattle. They generally carry about 2,000, so its down to 1,750 now. With that many passengers, the ferry wouldnt tip over even if everyone ran to the side at the same time to look at a pod of killer whales, he said. An example of a positive externality is the upkeep of your yard. If you keep your yard clean and even do some landscaping, you are not only increasing the value of your own home but also the value of the homes around you. For example, your neighbor may be able to more easily sell her or his house at a higher price. There is a mismatch between social marginal benefits/costs and private marginal benefits/costs which leads to an inefficient allocation of resources. As with the monopoly, there is a deadweight loss from externalities. Externalities arise if property rights have not been established, e.g., clean air, toys for children, fishing in a lake, congestion. People argue whether externalities are a market failure or failure of a markets to exist. For example, a polluting firm is essentially using clean air as an input for which it is not paying for. If a market existed for this input, as it does for labor and capital, the input would be priced in the market, i.e. the owner of clean air would have to agree to sell just as the owner of labor agrees to sell. Similarly, a positive externality is a product that is produced but no market exists and is consumed for free. Whether we are talking about positive or negative externalities, a deadweight loss exists and a good is either over-produced (negative externality) or under-produced (positive externality). The four figures below demonstrate the inefficiency of a negative externality. Figure 10.1: Consumer and Producer Surplus Figure 10.2: Societal Cost Figure 10.3: Deadweight Loss Figure 10.4: Efficient Outcome 10.1.1 Pigouvian Tax A Pigouvian tax is a per-unit production tax equal to the difference between social marginal cost and private marginal cost. It is difficult to implement because of unknown social costs of externality. By reducing the market quantity to the efficient quantity, a Pigouvian tax eliminates the DWL from the pollution externality. Difference between Pigouvian tax and pollution tax is that the former is a per-unit tax on output and the latter is a per-unit tax on pollution. 10.1.2 Coase Theorem The Coase Theorem states that if transaction costs are low or zero, the establishment of clear property rights will lead to an efficient allocation of resources. Participating parties will negotiate until a mutually advantageous (and efficient) solution is reached. This implies that no government intervention is necessary as long as property rights are established. Note, that the allocation of wealth and income will vary depending on how the property rights are established but that this does not affect efficiency. For example, assume a baker and a doctor are in the same building. The baker needs to run noisy machinery in order to bake bread and make a living. The doctor needs silence in order to practice in his office. The problem in this case is that the property rights with regard to the noise level in the building are not clearly established. Now suppose that the doctor could soundproof the walls at a cost of $100 and the baker could purchase quite machinery at a cost of $50. If the property noise level is given to the doctor, then the baker will purchase quite machinery for $50. If the noise level is attributed to the baker, the doctor will pay the baker $50 to purchase new and more quite machinery. The efficient solution, i.e., purchasing machinery for $50, is reached independently of who is assigned the property rights. 10.1.3 Pollution Control What is the optimal level of pollution? Waste is produced in almost any activity and thus, the optimal level of pollution is not equal to zero. Optimal level of pollution is a function of the social cost associated with pollution, e.g., effect on human health, aesthetic effects, as well as the cost of reducing pollution. The cost of reducing pollution is represented by the marginal abatement cost function. We will be looking at three different pollution control policies: Command-and-control: Under a command-and-control policy, there are either design standards that require the use of a particular technology or performance standards that set the maximum pollution level for individual sources. This policy achieves the desired outcome in terms of pollution but is inefficient. Emission tax: In an emission/pollution tax scenario, firms set the marginal cost of abatement equal to the tax rate and the aggregate cost for a given level of pollution is minimized. An emission tax is efficient. Cap-and-trade: Under a cap-and-trade policy, firms set the marginal cost of abatement equal to the permit price. Problems with cap-and-trade: leakage, e.g., fertilizer, coal, etc. A cap-and-trade policy is efficicent. Examples of cap-and trade in the U.S. are the Acid Rain Program and the Clean Air Act. Sulfur dioxide (SO\\(_2\\)) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) react in the atmosphere (with water oxygen and oxidants) to form various acid compounds. Health concern: detrimental effects. Ozone affects respiratory illnesses and contributing to permanent lung damage. Market based instruments focus on the quantity and cost of pollution reduction and not who generates the pollution. The animated maps on the website of the National Atmospheric Deposition Program illustrate the outcomes of those policies using the National Trends Network (NTN) concentration and deposition maps for a variety of pollutants. Assume two firms, 1 and 2, with the following total abatement cost function and marginal abatement cost function: \\[TC_1(a_1) = 3 a_1^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad MC_1(a_1) = 6 a_1 \\\\ TC_2(a_2) = 2 a_2^2 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad MC_2(a_2) = 4 a_2\\] Suppose that both firms emit 50 tons of pollution per year and the government wants to reduce pollution by 10 tons. Consider the following three scenarios: (1) Proportional reduction, (2) emission tax of $24 per ton, and (3) cap-and-trade system with a cap set to 40 tons. 10.1.4 Policy Examples: SO\\(_2\\) Allowance Trading Program Theoretically, a well designed pollution tax or cap-and-trade can minimize the total cost of achieving environmental protection Stavins (1998). The SO\\(_2\\) Allowance Trading Program established under Title IV of the Clean Air Act amendment of 1990 aimed at reducing emissions by 10 million tons over 1980 levels. The purpose of the program was to control for acid rain to reduce acidification of forest and aquatic ecosystems. However, there have been significant benefits to human health as well . In this program, it was also possible to bank allowances for later use. The compliance with the program was enforced by a penalty of $2,000 per ton of emissions exceeding the allowance together with the requirement to offset the emissions the following year. The program was mostly successful due to a liberalization in railroads Schmalensee and Stavins (2013). Also, the cost of the program was ten times cheaper than initially estimated Kerr (1998).

A good is rival if it cannot be consumed by more than one individual at a time. It is excludable if non-paying consumers can be excluded from consumption. Our primary focus so far has been on pure private goods - goods that are both rival and excludable. The Tragedy of the Commons arises when rival goods are made non-excludable through common ownership. Public goods are both non-rival and non-excludable; e.g. national defense, lighthouse. Club goods are non-rival but excludable; e.g. public swimming pools. Rival Non-Rival Excludable Private Good Club Good Non-Excludable Common Good Public Good Common goods lead to the ``Tragedy of the Commons, e.g., swimming pool as a club good, free rider problem.

So the total benefit to society can be written as \\[B_S(q_A,q_B) = 20(q_A+q_B) -1.5(q_A+q_B)^2-8(q_A+q_B)\\] Solving the first-order conditions leads to \\(20 -3(q_A+q_B)=8\\). Thus, societal benefit is maximized if \\(q_T=4\\). So if \\(MB_a=10-2q\\), \\(MB_b=10-q\\), and \\(MC=8\\), then we have \\[MB_a = MC \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad q = 1\\\\ MB_b = MC \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad q = 2\\] But since individual \\(A\\) has already purchased 1 unit, individual \\(B\\) will free ride and they will end up with 2 units.

The total population is denoted with \\(X\\) and the maximum fish population is denoted with \\(k\\) and is often referred to as the carrying capacity with unsustainable quantity after this amount. Before the peak, fish rapidly grow and there are plenty of food and space for the species. After the peak, depletion of the fish by the environment, food scarcity and less space for species. Assume that harvest is a result of effort (boats) and the fish population, i.e., \\(H = G(X,E)\\), with \\(X\\) representing fish population and \\(E\\) representing effort, i.e, boats, equipment, nets, bait, and so on. The more effort a fisherman expends, the higher the harvest. The higher the fish population, the more the fishermen catch. This means that there can be the same harvest rate but different levels of fish population and effort. In the steady state, the harvest rate equals net birth rate of the fish, i.e., \\(H = f(X)\\). Furthermore, assume that the price of fish is \\(p\\) and that the cost of effort is \\(c\\).

The asymmetric information problem that causes higher cost customer to ``adversely select into the market or, alternatively, that causes low quality suppliers to adversely select into the market. Moral hazard refers to the tendency to change behavior after entering a contract, especially a contract which reduces risk. Possible prevention of adverse selection is to eliminate the choice of informed people, e.g., providing insurance to everyone or by mandating that everyone buy insurance. Avoiding or preventing adverse selection can be achieved via signalling and/or screening. Assume that the demand for car insurance can be written as \\(q=20-2 \\cdot p\\) or \\(p=10-q/2\\). Further, the marginal cost associated with a safe driver is \\(MC_s=2\\) and the marginal cost associated with an unsafe driver is \\(MC_u=6\\). Without asymmetric information and in a perfectly competitive market, we have marginal cost pricing, that is \\[\\begin{align*} 2 &amp;= 10 - \\frac{q}{2} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\text{$q=16$ and $p=2$}\\\\ 6 &amp;= 10 - \\frac{q}{2} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\text{$q=8$ and $p=6$} \\end{align*}\\] Calculating the consumer surplus from this pricing policy, we can see that \\(CS_s=\\$ 128\\) and \\(CS_u =\\$32\\) leading to a total surplus of $160. If the insurance company has no way of telling whether a driver falls in the category safe'' orunsafe, it has to charge a uniform price.

Pollination: Pollination by bees is very important for plant reproduction and substantial fees are paid to beekeepers (Rucker et al., 2012). Imagine a beekeeper and an apple orchard farmer being neighbors. Note this is a situation of a positive externality. The beekeeper receives the revenue from selling honey but in the absence of any payments, does not receive any money for the bees pollinating nearby orchards or fields. Suppose that one beehive (\\(H\\)) can pollinate one acre. The pollination of an acre without the bees costs $20 per acre. The beekeeper can sell the honey from a beehive at $50. The total cost of the beekeeper is \\(TC = H^2 + 20\\) and marginal costs \\(MC = 2 \\cdot H\\). Represent this problem graphically. How many hives would the beekeeper maintain if operating independently of the farmer? What is the socially efficient number of hives? In the absence of transaction costs, what outcomes do you expect to arise from bargaining between the beekeeper and the farmer? How high would total transaction costs have to be to erase all gains from bargaining? Efficient Polluting Monopolist: In class, we have discussed that an externality and a monopoly, if looked at separately, lead to a deadweight loss. Using a graph, let us illustrate the case where a polluting monopolist can be efficient in the absence of any intervention. Draw a linear demand function and the corresponding marginal revenue function. Next, draw an upward sloping marginal cost function starting at the origin (note that the result does not change if you draw the marginal cost function with an intercept). Determine the profit maximizing output and price. Next draw an external marginal cost function such that the initially determine quantity and output are efficient, i.e., with no deadweight loss. Deadweight Loss from a Negative Externality: The demand function for a polluting good is \\(P=360-4 \\cdot Q\\).

Dena, Eric, and Cullen are its founders and current directors and believe that nutritious food choices are part of a healthy lifestyle. They have three restaurant locations: North, East, and South. At all three locations and each day, those restaurants serve meals including a small appetizer and a dessert. The non-profit has received an endowment of $1,000,000 from a local corporation under the constraint that meal prices cannot exceed $9 per meal. Since there are fixed costs and the marginal cost per meal is $7, Farm-to-Table 4 All has to rely on donations besides the food service provision and the endowment revenue. Besides providing good food, their main long-run objectives is to not run a deficit. Although nonprofit organizations do not disburse profits, they are subject to the same economic constraints than private firms. A loss over multiple years will ultimately lead to the demise of the organization. Since none of the three founders are economists (or have any basic understanding of economics at all), they asked you to help them with some of their decisions. Out of the goodness of your heart, you have decided to offer your consulting services for free. Farm-to-Table 4 All derives its revenue from three sources (engaging in all three of them is mandatory): (1) Food service provision, (2) donations, and (3) endowment. Food Service Provision: Over the last months, Farm-to-Table 4 All determined that the inverse demand for its services can be written as follows for the three locations (where \\(Q\\) is the quantity of meals demanded per month and \\(P\\) is the price per meal): North: \\(Q=2000-120 \\cdot P\\) East: \\(Q=1200-175 \\cdot P\\) South: \\(Q=1750-100 \\cdot P\\) Of course, the quantity demanded cannot be negative. All employees are volunteers and Farm-to-Table 4 All only has to pay the rent which is $1,000, $1,500, and $1,250 per month for the North, East, and South location, respectively. Note that they are able to price discriminate based on location. What this means is that they can charge different prices at different location. Donations from foundations, individuals, and/or industry: Donation amount \\(D\\) rise with the number of workers \\(L\\) hired that specialize in fundraising. The amount of donations is given by the function \\(D=90000 \\cdot L^{0.6}\\). Each worker is paid an annual wage of $40,000. Endowment: As aforementioned, they have received an endowment of $1,000,000. The endowment is invested in safe bonds and yields a return ranging from 1% to 5% depending on the macroeconomic environment. Because the returns are uncertain, the directors would like to do all your calculations for the possible range of returns in increments of 1%. The directors of Farm-to-Table 4 All need advise on how much fundraising to engage in and what price to charge for their meals. They want to keep the meal pricing simple and just want to know the meal pricing strategies using integer dollar amounts. They also know that any strategy which results in any loss is unacceptable. Also, the principal of the endowment can never be touched. The directors want you to answer the following questions (based on one year): How much to charge per meal at the three locations. Those pricing strategies should include the objective of maximizing the surplus/profit which can go into the endowment as well as maximizing the number of people served. How many people to hire for the fundraising activity. Be careful in differentiating between the monthly and yearly information above. This case study should be answered in yearly terms. The returns from the endowment are independent of the pricing strategy and the number of fundraisers hired. The number of fundraisers is independent of the pricing strategy and the endowment.

The DNR usually does not get involved with local issues like those explained in the following brief, but the issues of whether or not to open public outdoor recreation facilities is becoming a highly contested issue in the state. You have committed to providing the DNR with a brief report that analyzes the economic issues related the public facilities in two cities: SPEAton and SPEAville. Both cities are medium-sized and have approximately 200,000 residents. SPEAton has already opened an outdoor recreation area on 10 acres of land. The city acquired the land for $500,000. It cost an additional $500,000 to improve the land, which included clearing away trash, construction of parking facilities, and installation of baseball diamonds, basketball courts, and bike pathways. SPEAton borrowed the funds for land acquisition and improvement. The city borrowed the funds at 0% interest and needs to pay them back over 20 years, i.e. $50,000 total per year. The park covers 10 acres of land and is abutted by three interstate highways and bounded by an industrial zone. The current admission fee is $0.50. SPEAville is considering a similar project. City officials believe they can buy the land for the proposed project for $500,000 and make the necessary improvements for $500,000. They also plan to borrow the funds for land acquisition and improvement for the same conditions, i.e., payback of $50,000 per year for 20 years. Like the existing SPEAton park, the SPEAville project site is on 10 acres and bounded by a few interstate highways and an industrial zone. Based on related data of parks across the nation, an economist has completed a study that provides user demand at various prices for a medium-sized city of approximately 200,000 residents. The demand function is written as \\(Q=140,000-100,000 \\cdot P\\). For example, if the admission price is $0.50, the resulting yearly demand would be 90,000. In addition to construction and land acquisition, operating costs are estimated at $0.30 per user at both facilities. The two facilities are five hours apart so they would not be competing attractions. Like any public issue, investment of resources in a recreational facility has opponents and proponents. In SPEAton, the opponents argue that buying land from a private, out-of-state, owner has taken the $10,500 that was collected through property taxes off property tax roles (public land is exempt from property tax, i.e., no tax is collected on that land). They argue that the land should be sold. In fact, they know that the previous owner has offered to purchase the property back for $600,000, assuming that the land will be zoned for commercial use (the zoning designation prior to the citys acquisition). The city would receive $30,000 yearly for 20 years (\\(\\$30,000 \\cdot 20 = \\$600,000\\)). Reassessment of the property reflecting the higher market value would raise the annual tax revenues to $12,600. Although the merits of selling the parcel are disputed, all available information suggests that the sales price estimate presented by the opponents of the park is reliable, as is the estimate of the impact of returning the parcel to the tax roles. Proponents of the project reject the opponents argument. They reject selling the land and argue that the city would make the best use possible of the land by providing recreational facilities. They further argue that the city should focus on reducing the fee from $0.50 per person to $0.20 per person. The debate in SPEAville is centered around building the park or not. The land is currently zoned as commercial land and the property tax revenue is $10,500. A current reassessment confirmed this value. Other than that, the same demand, cost, and revenue calculations as in SPEAton apply. In addition, because the facilities are well served by existing roadways and public transit and because recreational trips tend to be off-peak the expanded use is not expected to add significantly to congestion or pollution in the area. The two towns are only considering admission fees ranging from $0 to $1.40. The Department of Natural Resources has been clear on the issues they want you to address which are the following: What is the quantity demanded and the consumer surplus for three admission fees: (1) Current fee, (2) No fee, and (3) Optimal fee? Calculate the accounting profit resulting from admission revenue, operating cost, and loan repayment. What is the total economics benefit if consumer surplus is taken into account? Based on these estimates of benefits and costs, do you recommend that the sell the facility in SPEAton? If so, why? If not, at what admission fee should the park be operated? Assuming that no significant impacts would result from the project other than the direct impacts of additional recreational use, what are the quantity demanded, the consumer surplus, and the accounting and total economic benefit associated with the project in SPEAville? Based on an assessment of total benefits and total costs to city residents, should SPEAville build a recreational facility? Explain why this answer is the same or different from the answer to whether SPEAton should operate a recreational facility? What types of costs and benefits were omitted in the analysis for both SPEAton and SPEAville? What this imply about the use of costs and benefits for decision making? Because you feel a little overwhelmed, you quickly send an email to your SPEA-V 517 instructor. You ask him for a little assistance in putting this report together. Here are the responses: You are given demand function to do the calculations. Remember that the consumer surplus is the area above the price and below the demand function. The choke price is $1.40. So the formula for the consumer surplus as a function of quantity and price is: \\[CS = (1.4-P) \\cdot \\frac{Q}{2}\\] For both cities, you should compare the cost and benefits with and without a park. You should set up an Excel spreadsheet similar to table found in the sheet NONPROFIT. Calculate the total economic benefits with the park and without the park for both cities. The land improvement cost for SPEAton are sunk cost and cannot be recovered. They have done the improvements and hence, they have to pay back the loan of $50,000 and get the $30,000 from the previous owner. You have to take the difference. In general, think about the flow of money with and without the park and keep in mind that we have consumer surplus. For SPEAville, the issues are slightly different compared to SPEAton because they have not build the park and thus, the loan repayments will be absent. You also had a colleague help you by doing a literature review of cost-benefit analysis of recreational facilities in a medium-sized city. They put together a few important points (see below). You do not need to address the literature review in your analysis. However, it might be helpful for answering the final question of interest to DNR. Green space in an urban area is considered an amenity. Several researchers have found that it increases nearby property values. Urban attractions, like recreational facilities, have been found to increase sales at local business establishments. Crime can increase surrounding new amenities in an urban area. Some argue that increased sales to nearby establishments is simply a shift from other establishments in the local area. Obesity is a problem the state of SPEAstate. Recreational facilities are often used as ways to clean up abandoned areas. Industrial sites can sometimes produce negative externalities to neighboring properties. Traffic congestion can result from urban attractions. Some researchers have found that nearness to recreation facilities increases physical activities of some residents. Crime is sometimes a problem on vacant parcels of an urban area. Youth in organized recreational programs are more likely to not create social disturbances than youth who do not participate in organized recreation programs. Industrial and commercial parcels produce more tax revenue and require less tax revenue than residential parcels. "],["environmental-policy.html", "11.3 Environmental Policy", " 11.3 Environmental Policy You are a policy analyst for the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) in SPEAstate. The two largest firms in SPEAstate are SPEAoil (oil refinery) and SPEApaper (paper mill). Both firms are located at a river and discharge the identical pollutant into the river. The DNR would like to increase the water quality because recreational activities downstream are sometimes restricted due to a high concentration of pollutants. The DNR considers three possible policies: (1) command and control, (2) pollution tax, and (3) cap-and-trade. Currently, the total quantity of pollutants discharged into the river by both firms is 170 tons per year. SPEAoil and SPEApaper contribute 90 and 80 tons, respectively. Each firm has one pipe discharging the pollutant into the river and hence, the DNR can determine exactly how much pollution is coming from each firm. The goal of the DNR is to limit total pollution to 130 tons per year. For all policy scenarios, the DNR is interested in the quantity of pollution and abatement for each firm and in total. In addition, they want to know the cost to each firm, the revenue to the government (if any) and the societal cost of the policies. To reduce pollution, SPEAoil and SPEApaper can install abatement technology. If \\(a_o\\) and \\(a_p\\) are the quantities abated by SPEAoil and SPEApaper, respectively, then the total cost and marginal costs can be written as: \\(TC(a_o) = 4 \\cdot a_o^2\\), \\(TC(a_p) = 3 \\cdot a_p^2\\), \\(MC(a_o) = 8 \\cdot a_o\\), and \\(MC(a_p) = 6 \\cdot a_p\\).\\ Command-and-Control Policy: The DNR limits the total pollution discharged to 130 tons and imposes separate emission standard for each firm. The emission standard allows each firm to pollute proportional to its current pollution. Emission Tax I: The second policy option taxes each ton of pollutant at $120. Hence, each firm can chose to invest in abatement or can pay the tax on emissions. Calculate each firms abatement and total cost associated with this policy. How much money will the government collect? Does the DNR achieve the target pollution level? The amount spent by the firm is composed of the abatement amount and the tax payment. A table of the following form is recommended: Cap-and-Trade Under the cap-and-trade option, the DNR allocates 65 emission permits to each firm. The emission permit gives the firm the right to pollute. For example, if a firm owns 65 permits, it has the right to discharge 65 tons of pollutant. If it discharges more, a very expensive fine is imposed. After the permit allocation, the DNR then allows the firms to sell and buy the permits to each other. How many permits will each firm buy and sell? Note that the total cost to firms includes the expense/revenue from buying/selling the permits. What is the permit price?\\ Emission Tax II: Revisit the emission tax scenario but with a modified tax rate, i.e., assume the DNR would set the tax rate to the permit price found under the Cap-and-Trade scenario. Compare the cost to the firms of the tax and the cap-and-trade system. What are your conclusions?

Your term is not going well due to rising crime, social injustice, and a crumbling infrastructure. You are now facing an additional problem related to transportation in your city. A start-up ride-sharing company called Unter started to operate in your city. Their business model is simple. You download an app to your phone and you can be either (1) a driver offering rides to customers or (2) a customer ordering rides to a particular destination. The app knows the location of the customer who orders a ride and sends the closest driver to pick them up. Needless to say, the local taxi drivers are in uproar. Unter also uses what is called surge pricing which means that they raise the price when demand is high. Surge pricing is not used by taxis and cab drivers argue that the surge pricing is unfair to consumers. You vaguely remember from your economics class the concepts of consumer surplus, producer surplus, and deadweight loss. You come to the conclusion, that you may want to look at this from an economic perspective. At the end of your analysis, you should be able to answer the following basic questions (among others): Should Unter be allowed to operate in your city from a societal welfare perspective? Should Unter be allowed to use surge pricing in the case of high demand? You have to answer those questions and provide context and explanations to your administration. You have the following information. The regular demand for rides (either cabs or Unter) is written as: \\[Q=3250-500 \\cdot P\\] The peak (also known as surge) demand function is written as: \\[Q=4750-500 \\cdot P\\] Unter and the cab companies operating in your city are using a similar vehicle fleet. So the marginal cost function can be written as: \\[MC=0.5+0.001 \\cdot Q\\] Currently, the number of cabs operating in your city is fixed at 1500. In reality, cities distribute so-called medallions to taxi drivers. There is a limited number of medallions and thus, the number of taxis is limited by the number of medallions distributed. Also, cabs are not allowed to change their price based on demand. The price they must use is the equilibrium price under normal demand. Prepare a policy brief which examines the two broad questions mentioned above but with more in-depth analysis. Calculate the consumer surplus, producer surplus under all possible situations. That is, with or without Unter, with or without surge pricing for cabs and/or Unter, etc. Be as thorough as possible.

The demand functions resulting from the Cobb-Douglas utility function are written as: \\[\\begin{align*} x_G &amp;= \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\cdot \\frac{m}{p_G}\\\\ x_A &amp;= \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha + \\beta} \\cdot \\frac{m}{p_A}\\\\ \\end{align*}\\] where \\(m\\) represents the income of the consumer and prices for gasoline and other goods are denoted as \\(p_G\\) and \\(p_A\\), respectively. The current gasoline wholesale price (i.e., price without tax) is $2.30. The current tax rate on gasoline is $0.20 per gallon. The wholesale price on other goods is $1.00 and the sales tax is 6%. Note that there is no sales tax on gasoline. The current income tax rate is flat at 3% independent of income. Current Situation: Unchanged income and gasoline tax. 20% Gasoline Tax Increase: The gasoline tax increases by 20% and the other taxes are unchanged. 20% Gasoline Tax Increase, Tax Credit, and Flat Income Tax Increase: In this scenario, residents earning less than $40,000 before taxes receive a tax credit of $200. To finance the tax credit, the income tax which is currently at 3% is raised uniformly. 20% Gasoline Tax Increase, Tax Credit, and Tiered Income Tax Increase: In this scenario, residents earning less than $40,000 before taxes receive a tax credit of $200. To finance the tax credit, the income tax rate which is raised for residents earning more than $40,000. The sales and income tax go into the General Fund. That means that both taxes serve as substitutes for each other. The gas tax goes into the Highway and Road Fund. Money between the General Fund and the Highway and Road Fund are not exchangeable, i.e., there is no cross-subsidization.
